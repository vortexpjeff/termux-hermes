# Hermes Agent for ARM64 Termux

This repository is a pinned, integrity-verified packaging and release pipeline
for running Hermes Agent on ARM64 Termux. It builds the Android-native Python
wheelhouse and a complete APT-managed `hermes-agent` package so
resource-constrained devices do not compile the Rust and C dependency graph
locally.

## Repository scope

This repository contains:

- pinned source, interpreter, container, and dependency manifests;
- native Android wheel builders and integrity checks;
- a complete Termux `.deb` packager with clean-container installation smokes;
- immutable release workflows and a separately maintained recovery path.

It is distribution infrastructure, not a fork of the Hermes Agent application.
Device identities, credentials, provider configuration, conversations, and
post-install device experiments are not package inputs and are not published in
release artifacts.

| Surface | Current status |
| --- | --- |
| Public recovery script | Installs the established `0.20.6+termux2` package |
| Hermes 0.21 package | Verified immutable `0.21.0+termux1` ARM64 release |
| Python runtime | Signed TUR `python3.13=3.13.13` |
| Supported target | Official Termux-compatible ARM64 Android userspace |

## One-command install and recovery

For an existing native Termux aarch64 installation—including an interrupted
Git update with a stale `.git/index.lock`—run:

```bash
curl -fsSL --retry 6 --retry-all-errors https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adybag14-cyber/termux-hermes/main/install.sh | bash
```

The recovery path verifies the signed APT repository, repairs upstream Termux
mirror skew only when package simulation proves it is broken, downloads the
latest immutable `hermes-agent` package with resumable transfers and two
independent sources, repairs an incomplete dpkg transaction, and accepts an
existing official Termux Python 3.13 instead of installing a conflicting second
owner. It preserves `~/.hermes`, migrates the configuration, caps OpenRouter
output at 8,192 tokens to avoid unaffordable 32K–65K requests, verifies that
future updates use `pkg upgrade`, and restarts the gateway without requiring
users to paste a multi-line shell fragment.

The package download prefers the immutable GitHub release asset, falls back to
the Oracle APT origin, and verifies the pinned package SHA-256 before local APT
installation. It also recovers an existing APT partial download when present,
including bytes left by a failed `pkg install`. An interrupted transfer remains in
`~/.cache/hermes-recovery/` so rerunning the same one-line command resumes the
existing bytes instead of starting the 63.9 MB download again. A successful
installation removes that cache file.

Set `HERMES_RECOVERY_MAX_TOKENS` before the command to choose a different
positive output cap.

## Native `pkg install hermes-agent` package

The public recovery script remains pinned to the last published Debian package,
`0.20.6+termux2`; it does not yet install the verified `0.21.0+termux1` artifact.
The 0.21.0 package's Python dependency accepts an installed Termux `python`
package in the 3.13 series; otherwise it uses the signed side-by-side
`python3.13` package. This avoids overlapping ownership of `pydoc3.13` while
keeping Hermes on its verified CPython 3.13 ABI after rolling Termux advances to
Python 3.14.

This repository also builds a complete native Termux `.deb` for Hermes Agent. The package is not a thin Python wheel: it contains the full Hermes runtime/source assets and a prevalidated CPython 3.13 virtual environment produced by the existing immutable Android wheelhouse flow. The package is stamped as an APT-managed install, so `hermes update` does not mutate package-owned files and instead directs users to `pkg upgrade hermes-agent`.

## Verified 0.21 package

The immutable package release is available at
[`hermes-agent-termux-0.21.0-20260907.1`](https://github.com/vortexpjeff/termux-hermes/releases/tag/hermes-agent-termux-0.21.0-20260907.1):

```text
hermes-agent_0.21.0+termux1_aarch64.deb
SHA-256: 531d4afbe88f75f5092f95b874979c410e71b0a0778864ee4095ec64110bb9e8
```

After enabling `tur-repo`, the package installation path is:

```bash
pkg install tur-repo
pkg update
pkg install python3.13=3.13.13

package="${TMPDIR:-$PREFIX/tmp}/hermes-agent_0.21.0+termux1_aarch64.deb"
curl -fL --retry 6 --retry-all-errors \
  https://github.com/vortexpjeff/termux-hermes/releases/download/hermes-agent-termux-0.21.0-20260907.1/hermes-agent_0.21.0%2Btermux1_aarch64.deb \
  -o "$package"
printf '%s  %s\n' \
  531d4afbe88f75f5092f95b874979c410e71b0a0778864ee4095ec64110bb9e8 \
  "$package" | sha256sum -c -
apt install "$package"
rm -f "$package"
```

The release passed package-contract inspection, two clean Termux installation
smokes against signed TUR Python 3.13.13, native-extension imports, package
consistency, and `hermes --version`. A separate physical ARM64 Android 10/API 29
installation also passed dpkg installation, CLI startup, native imports, and a
bounded provider turn.

Device identity, credentials, provider-specific compatibility changes,
persistence, power behavior, and fleet integration remain deployment concerns.
They are deliberately excluded from this generic wheelhouse/package repository
and are not claims made by the published 0.21.0 artifact.

`build-hermes-package.yml` builds on a native ARM GitHub runner in the pinned official Termux Docker userspace, installs Hermes through the native installer, validates the runtime imports, assembles the `.deb`, and installs that `.deb` into a second clean Termux container before an immutable GitHub release may be published. `apt-hermes-smoke.yml` separately validates installation from the live signed APT repository.

The public APT repository is a contributor-operated distribution/proving path. It does **not** replace the separate upstream requirement that canonical Hermes Termux binary artifacts eventually be built and released by NousResearch-owned CI.

## Locked target

- Hermes source: `NousResearch/hermes-agent@29112bef099274229cadff79cdff7bf7b99c4b77` (`v2026.8.31`, Hermes 0.21.0)
- Audited runtime: official Termux app GitHub build `v0.118.3` on Android 15/API 35
- ARM build environment: official `termux/termux-docker` image pinned to `sha256:3aed9c7fbcf9195a9919deaad418da006232864a779fb4f322d68a34887a2e15`
- Python: signed TUR `python3.13=3.13.13`, selected through APT after installing `tur-repo` from official Termux main
- Architecture: `aarch64`
- Wheel platform: `android_24_arm64_v8a`
- Dependency profile: Hermes `termux`

Every source distribution URL, version and SHA-256 is stored in
[`manifest/wheels.json`](manifest/wheels.json). A release is never updated in
place: the workflow refuses to publish when its tag already exists.

## Current native wheel set

The current Hermes Termux lock resolves to 75 exact packages under Python 3.13.
Eleven packages require Android-native wheels from this repository; the remaining
packages are satisfied by compatible binary or universal wheels during the
binary-only verification install. The native set is:

The prior 91-package Android-emulator discovery snapshot is retained as historical
evidence in [`audit/emulator-audit.json`](audit/emulator-audit.json). It describes
the earlier lock and is not republished as evidence for a refreshed release. The
current exact 75-package resolver output is [`audit/resolved.txt`](audit/resolved.txt),
with direct requirements and lock constraints stored beside it.

## Build design

The `Build immutable arm64 wheelhouse` workflow runs on a native arm64 Ubuntu runner
and executes the build inside Termux's official aarch64 Docker image at a fixed
registry digest. Package discovery and final installation behavior were separately
verified in the official Termux v0.118.3 Android app. The builder:

1. verifies the pinned Python `.deb` and every PyPI sdist before extraction;
2. rejects traversal, symlink and device members in source archives;
3. builds serially with pinned setuptools, Cython, pybind11 and maturin versions;
4. patches psutil's Android platform detection;
5. emits or normalizes PEP 738 Android wheel tags;
6. rewrites `WHEEL` and `RECORD` correctly when normalization is required;
7. verifies package/version/tag, ZIP integrity and native extension presence;
8. installs the complete current 75-package graph with `--only-binary :all:` in a clean venv;
9. imports every native package and runs `uv pip check`;
10. records the exact installed Termux system package versions;
11. publishes wheels, `index.json`, `system-packages.txt`, and `SHA256SUMS` under a new immutable release tag.

## Run locally in native aarch64 Termux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adybag14-cyber/termux-hermes.git
cd termux-hermes
bash scripts/termux_build.sh "$PWD"
```

The complete wheelhouse is written to
`~/termux-hermes-build/wheelhouse/`. This build is intentionally resource-heavy;
normal users should consume the published release assets instead.

The automated arm64 release build uses the official Termux Docker image by immutable
digest. The image exists specifically to run the Termux environment off-device; it
contains the Termux bootstrap and the AOSP/Bionic runtime components needed by the
Android-targeted Python toolchain.
The workflow invokes `scripts/termux_build.sh /workspace /build docker`; the explicit
mode keeps Docker validation independent of environment variables sanitized by the
Termux container entrypoint.

## Refreshing the lock

Do not edit package versions without regenerating the Termux requirements and
resolver inputs against an exact Hermes commit. A refresh must update together:

- `audit/direct.in`
- `audit/lock-constraints.txt`
- `audit/resolved.txt`
- `manifest/wheels.json`
- this README table

`audit/emulator-audit.json` and the older `audit/build-metadata.json` are retained
as historical evidence for the release that produced them; do not silently relabel
them as proof of a newer lock. Current compatibility metadata can be generated in
native Termux with:

```bash
python3.13 scripts/audit_pypi.py \
  --resolved audit/resolved.txt \
  --output audit/refreshed-emulator-audit.json
```

A new wheelhouse must use a new release tag. Existing release assets must never
be replaced.
